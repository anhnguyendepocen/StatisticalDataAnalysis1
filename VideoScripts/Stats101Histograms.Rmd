### **Correction to the Video**

There is one error in the video that you need to keep in mind as you work with data. In addition to the bins of the histogram not overlapping, a standard histogram also generally needs to have bins of the same width. Variable width bins is a different kind of plot (e.g., an equal probability histogram) that needs to have a specific rationale.

### **Smartphone User Example**

#### Read in the Dataset 

The data is in a CSV file stored on the web, so we will read it into RStudio using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse package (which has been loaded above). It is always good to inspect the structure of a dataset, especially if you have not used it before.

```{r}
smartphones <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Stats101/stats101smartphones.csv")
glimpse(smartphones)
```

#### Making Histograms

##### Default Histogram

The default setting for `bins` in `geom_histogram()` is 30. Too many!  

```{r}
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

##### Histogram with One Bin

Here is the "histoblob" mentioned in the video. The maximum age value in the dataset is 70, so that is the upper end of the plot in `R`. Differences from the video are due to the software used and the flexible nature of histograms. 

```{r}
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 1)
```

##### Histogram with Three Bins

The bins and the histogram in the video are slightly incorrect because the leftmost bin is not the same size (width on the number line) as the others. We can specify bins multiple ways. The color and axis scaling help us visualize better where bins start and stop. Notice that different methods give us different plots.

```{r}
# specify using number of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", bins = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5))

# specify using width of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", binwidth = 20) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100,5))   # we can abbreviate the seq code

# specify using boundaries of bins
# this is good for comparing plots
# the intervals are (lower, upper]
# aka, lower < age value <= upper
# reverse this using closed = left
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", breaks = seq(15, 75, 20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))
```

##### Histogram with Six Bins

The bins and the histogram in the video are slightly incorrect because the leftmost bin is not the same size (width on the number line) as the others. We can specify bins multiple ways. The color and axis scaling help us visualize better where bins start and stop. Notice that different methods give us different plots.

```{r}
# specify using number of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", bins = 6) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))

# specify using width of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))

# specify using boundaries of bins
# this is good for comparing plots
# the intervals are (lower, upper]
# aka, lower < age value <= upper
# reverse this using closed = left
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", breaks = seq(15, 75, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))
```

##### Histogram with Twelve Bins

The bins and the histogram in the video are slightly incorrect because the leftmost bin is not the same size (width on the number line) as the others. We can specify bins multiple ways. The color and axis scaling help us visualize better where bins start and stop. Notice that different methods give us different plots.

```{r}
# specify using number of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", bins = 12) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))

# specify using width of bins
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", binwidth = 5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))

# specify using boundaries of bins
# this is good for comparing plots
# the intervals are (lower, upper]
# aka, lower < age value <= upper
# reverse this using closed = left
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#2961EB", color = "black", breaks = seq(15, 75, 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))
```
