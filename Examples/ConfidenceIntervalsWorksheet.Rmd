### Michelson's Light Speed Data

Albert Michelson (1852â€“1931) was an American physicist known for his work on measuring the speed of light. He was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for science (1907). The `Michelson` dataset from the `HistData` package contains Michelson's measurements of the velocity of light in air, made which he made from June 5 to July 2, 1879 and reported in Michelson (1882). The data values + 299,000 are Michelson's measurements in km/sec. The currently accepted value of the speed of light in air is 299,702.547 km/sec.

### Bangladesh Well Data -- Mean

Bangladesh has suffered the largest population-level poisoning in history. Millions of people were exposed to naturally-occurring arsenic from tube-wells. Ironically, the wells had been installed to provide cleaner water than surface sources in order to reduce gastrointestinal diseases. Studies in other countries with long-term exposure to arsenic in groundwater found that 1 in 10 people who consume water containing 500 micrograms of arsenic per liter (mcg/l) may ultimately die from cancers caused by arsenic. The `Bangladesh` dataset from the textbook *Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R* (found in the `resampledata` package) contains a sample of tested wells.

### Questions / Discussion

Does the interval created using Michelson's data contain the currently accepted value of the speed of light in air? If not, what might be the explanation?

**ANSWER:**


There are about 5 million tube wells in Bangladesh (serving many millions of people). How many wells are potentially impacted by high levels of arsenic?
