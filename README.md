# Statistical Data Analysis 1

STT3850 Statistical Data Analysis 1 course repository

[Catalogue Description:](http://bulletin.appstate.edu/) This course provides an overview of modern statistical data analysis. Programming with data, including simulations and bootstrapping, will be an integral part of the course. Techniques for parsing univariate and multivariate data sets will be examined. Coverage of probability, random variables, standard probability distributions and statistical sampling distributions will be sufficient to prepare the student for statistical inference. Inferential topics will include parameter estimation, hypothesis testing for proportions, means and medians, goodness of fit tests, and tests for independence. Standard and computationally intensive regression techniques will also be covered. 

Some additional materials (e.g., projects, exams, solutions) are kept in a private repository. If you are an instructor who is interested in seeing these materials, please contact me at thomleyje@appstate.edu.
