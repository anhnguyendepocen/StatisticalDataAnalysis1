## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## What is a Factor in `R`?

By default, `R` displays the possible values of a character vector in ascending alphabetical order. When we summarize, visualize, or model with categorical variables, we often want their categories to appear in a different order. 

Structurally, factor variables are stored as unique integers with attached labels that are used for display. This is similar to how logical vectors display `TRUE` and `FALSE` but are stored as 0's and 1's "under the hood". 

The set of possible values of a factor are are known as *levels*.

The `factor()` function is used to create and modify factors in base `R` and the tidyverse contains a package called forcats that offers other useful functions.


## Revisiting An Example

The [STT3850majors.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/stt3850majors.csv) dataset contains information regarding students in Dr. Thomley's past STT3850 classes. 

`students <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/stt3850majors.csv"))`

```{r echo=FALSE}
students <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/stt3850majors.csv"))
```

* College = ASU college the student is in (e.g., Arts & sciences)
* Year = student's class year (e.g., freshman, sophomore)
* BannerMajor = student's major as listed in banner
* CodedMajor = Dr. Thomley's recoded list of majors
* Semester = the semester when the student took STT3850
* AY = academic year (e.g., 2018-2019)


## Dataset Structure

What are the current vector types of variables in the dataset?

```{r}
glimpse(students)
```

All the variables are stored as character (`<chr>`) vectors.


## Class Years

Notice the `Year` categories are not in the standard order. We should probably convert the character variable to a factor. Then we can choose an order other than alphabetical.

```{r}
students %>% 
  count(Year) %>% 
  mutate(percents = 100 * prop.table(n))
```


## Converting to a Factor

We know from our previous table that there are five categories or levels. Let's create a vector that puts all of the levels in the order we want them. Then create our factor using `factor()` to replace the original version.

```{r}
students <- students %>% 
  mutate(Year = factor(Year, 
                       levels = c("Freshman", 
                                  "Sophomore", 
                                  "Junior", 
                                  "Senior", 
                                  "Graduate Certificate Program")))
glimpse(students$Year)
```


## Dataset Structure

Since we saved the factor using the original dataset and variable names, the original character variable has been replaced.

```{r}
glimpse(students)
```

Now year is stored as a factor (`<fct>`) vector.


## Converting Several Variables

The advantage of `tidyverse` way is being able to recode many variables at once. Breaking the levels vectors across lines is OK in `R` since the program is looking for the closing `)` as the end-of-function, and is often good for easier reading.

```{r}
students <- students %>% 
  mutate(Year = factor(Year, levels = c("Freshman",
                                        "Sophomore",
                                        "Junior",
                                        "Senior",
                                        "Graduate Certificate Program")),
         CodedMajor = factor(CodedMajor, 
                             levels = c("Computer Science",
                                        "Mathematical Sciences",
                                        "Other Sciences",
                                        "Other")))
```


##

```{r}
# Formatting using Code > Reformat Code in RStudio (Ctrl+Shift+A) 
students <- students %>%
  mutate(Year = factor(
    Year,
    levels = c(
      "Freshman",
      "Sophomore",
      "Junior",
      "Senior",
      "Graduate Certificate Program"
    )
  ),
  CodedMajor = factor(
    CodedMajor,
    levels = c(
      "Computer Science",
      "Mathematical Sciences",
      "Other Sciences",
      "Other"
    )
  ))
```


## Now the Years Table Again

The class years are now in the customary order, as determined by the imposed factor structure. 

```{r}
students %>% 
  count(Year) %>% 
  mutate(percents = 100 * prop.table(n))
```


## And the Majors Table

Now the catch-all `Other` category is last, as is typically seen in summaries, because of the imposed structure. There are also *ordered factors* that have additional structure for higher level analyses. We do not need those for EDA.

```{r}
students %>% 
  count(CodedMajor) %>% 
  mutate(percents = 100 * prop.table(n))
```


## Recoding Factors

Sometimes we want to rename or combine some factor levels. The `fct_recode` function from the `forcats` package allows us to do this. The function `fct_collapse()` is another alternative. This time we will create a new variable `Year2`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)   # or library(forcats)
students <- students %>% 
  mutate(Year2 = fct_recode(Year,
                            FR = "Freshman",
                            SO = "Sophomore",
                            JR = "Junior",
                            SR = "Senior",
                            GR = "Graduate Certificate Program"))
glimpse(students$Year2)
```


## Combining Levels with `fct_recode()`

Assigning more than one level to the same new level name will combine the levels. Here all the majors besides `Mathematical Sciences` become one group.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)   # or library(forcats)
students <- students %>% 
  mutate(CodedMajor2 = fct_recode(CodedMajor,
                                  "Math" = "Mathematical Sciences",
                                  "Not Math" = "Computer Science",
                                  "Not Math" = "Other Sciences",
                                  "Not Math" = "Other"))
glimpse(students$CodedMajor2)
```


## Recoded Variable Table

```{r}
students %>% 
  count(CodedMajor2) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = prop.table(n))
```

Notice that the levels are ordered as they were originally. Since Computer Science was the first category before, now Not Math is first because it contains Computer Science.

How could we fix this so that Math is the first row in the table?


## Use a Single `mutate()` Statement

In these examples, you could combine both the `fact_recode()` functions in the same `mutate()` statement you used to create your factors. That is another advantage of the `tidyverse` way. This example has  just `Year` due to limited slide space.

```{r}
students <- students %>% 
  mutate(Year = factor(Year, levels = c("Freshman",
                                        "Sophomore",
                                        "Junior",
                                        "Senior",
                                        "Graduate Certificate Program")),
         Year2 = fct_recode(Year,
                            FR = "Freshman",
                            SO = "Sophomore",
                            JR = "Junior",
                            SR = "Senior",
                            GR = "Graduate Certificate Program"))
```
