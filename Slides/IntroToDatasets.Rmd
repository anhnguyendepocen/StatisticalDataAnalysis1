## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## Data vs. Information

Statistical methods help us transform raw data into information that provides knowledge and helps us make decisions.

* We use *descriptive statistics* to summarize datasets or make comparisons between datasets, but we do not go beyond the data we actually have. 

* In *inferential statistics*, we use sample data to generalize or make predictions about the larger population from which the sample was selected.

* Data visualization is important for exploration, verification, and presentation of statistical results.

The *distribution* of a population/variable describes its possible values and how often those values occur.

We process raw data with statistical methods to extract usable information. But that is only part of the story! To give statistical results meaning and learn from them, we must interpet them in the *appropriate context*.


## Population vs. Sample

A sample is a subset selected from some larger population of interest. The  population is defined by the research question(s) being investigated. It is the complete set of people, objects, or entities in which we are interested.

* A summary measure for a *population* is called a *parameter*.

* A summary measure for a *sample* is called a *statistic*.

Sample statistics are used to *estimate* population parameters.

If we collect data from a whole population, it is called a *census*.

The defining characteristics of theoretical probability models are also parameters. For example, the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ in a Normal model or $n$ and $p$ in a Binomial.


## Parameter vs. Statistic

We commonly represent theoretical or population parameters using Greek letters and statistics using Roman letters, but the usage can vary. Some texts also use Greek letters topped by ^ when referring to estimates of parameters. 

&nbsp;                 |parameter |statistic or estimate
:---------------------:|:--------:|:--------------------:
mean                   |$\mu$     |$\bar{x}$
variance               |$\sigma^2$|$s^2$
standard deviation     |$\sigma$  |$s$
general parameter |$\theta$  |$\widehat{\theta}$


## Dataset Structure

* A *variable* is some characteristic of interest that can differ between individuals in a population.

* An observational unit (or *observation*) is a single individual, object, or entity about which collect data, regarding one or more of its characteristics (variables).

* An observation may be called a case, subject, or participant.

* Ideally, each observational unit has a value for each variable.

A *dataset* is a collection of data values for the observations and variables in a study (e.g., survey or experiment). A common way to arrange data is to put variables in columns and observations in rows. This is what we call *tidy* data. 


## Tidy Data

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png" width = 775><br>

<p>Most of the data we will work with in STT3850 is already in tidy format, though there may be missing data and other issues we have to address before conducting analyses.</p>

<p>Real life data is usually far messier and can require a great deal of tidying, but is beyond the scope of this class.</p>


## Types of Variables

categorical or qualitative variables

* nominal scale
* ordinal scale

numerical or quantitative variables

* interval scale
* ratio scale

Numerical variables are also classified as discrete or continuous. Ranks are technically ordinal data, but sometimes we treat them as if they are numbers (e.g., reporting average rank).

How might these correspond to different classes of vectors in `R`?


## Vectors in `R`

Atomic vectors can contain only one type of data, while lists can contain more than one type. A *data frame* or *tibble* (dataset) in `R` is a special types of list. NULL is the absence of a vector.

## Exploring Your Dataset

Before doing any kind of data modeling or inference, you need to examine your dataset and become familiar with its structure and contents---this is *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*.

John Tukey (1915â€“2000), author of the seminal book *Exploratory Data Analysis* (1977), referred to EDA as numerical, counting, and graphical detective work. He is also credited with introducing the now-familiar terms "bit" and "software" while working with early computers at Bell Labs.

We will be using the *dplyr* and *ggplot2* packages for EDA. These tools, *readr*, and more are part of the *tidyverse*.

Many different types of data files can be read into `R`. We will be using primarily CSV files read from `R` packages or the web using their URL. Our [class data files](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/DatasetList.html) page contains many datasets.


## Reading Data into `R`

A data frame or tibble is a two dimensional structure or array in `R`. It is a special case of a list where each component (column) has equal length and can contain a different variable type.

The base `R` function `read.csv()` function can read a CSV file into `R` using a URL and convert it to a data frame. 

The readr package or tidyverse package contains a function `read_csv()`. It converts the input CSV into a tibble.

A tibble is a somewhat tweaked version of a data frame found in the tidyverse. For more, see [R for Data Science: Tibbles](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html).

We will use `read_csv()` because it does not impose structure we might not want on vectors; e.g., character variables do not automatically get turned into factors.


## Example Dataset

Consider the `Spruce` dataset from Chapter 1 of Chihara, L. and Hesterberg, T. (2018). *Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R, Second Ed.* We can find it in the **resampledata** package, which contains all the textbook datasets.

```{r}
library(resampledata)
head(Spruce, 3) # view the first two observations
```


## Structure vs. Glimpse

The `str()` function is part of base `R` code, while the `glimpse()` function comes from the tidyverse package dplyr.

```{r}
str(Spruce)
```


##

The two functions are similar, but how does the output differ? Look at the vector types and the way information about type of vector, number of variables, and observations is displayed. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(Spruce)
```


## Other Useful Functions

Other functions for exploring dataset structure are given below. Use them `Spruce`. What information does each one give you?

* `attributes()`
* `dim()`
* `names()`
* `nrow()`
* `ncol()`
* `head()`
* `tail()`
* `sum(complete.cases())` # this is two nested functions
* `sum(!complete.cases())` # what does the ! do?


## Loading Data from a URL

Our [class data files](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/DatasetList.html) page contains many datasets stored in CSV format. We can read them in using their URL.

`library(tidyverse)`  
`draftdata <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft.csv"))`

We can shortcut this code a bit. Check the documentation for `read_csv()` by typing `?read_csv` in the console.

`draftdata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft.csv")`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
draftdata <- read.csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/vietnamdraft.csv"))
```

## Explore some more datasets!

Try exploring some of the datasets presented and discussed in Chapter 1 of your  *Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and `R`, Second Edition* textbook. 

You can find instructor-created data files on our [class data files](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/DatasetList.html) page. `R` packages such as *datasets*, *HistData*, *mosaicData*, *MASS*, and others have datasets. You can check for data in any package using `data(package="packagename")`. A listing will pop up in a tab in RStudio's Source pane.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(package = "resampledata")
```

Practice so that you become proficient in loading a dataset and determining its structure so you can start the important work of transforming raw data into useful information and knowledge.
