## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## Notation and Parameters

The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Very few concepts in real life are truly normally distributed, but many are _approximately_ normal. The normal is also the limiting distribution for many common statistics and other distributions when sample size n $\rightarrow \infty$.

$$X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

$x$ = {-$\infty$ to +$\infty$} = *sample space*  
$\mu$ = the mean (or expected value) of the distribution  
$\sigma^2$ = the variance of the distribution  

The **standard normal** distribution $Z$ has $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma^2$ = $\sigma$ = 1.


## Probability Density Function (pdf)

Unlike the pmfs in discrete distributions, the probability density function (pdf) of a continuous distribution does not compute a probability, because the area under a point is zero. Instead, the pdf gives the height of the function (y) at x. Below is the pdf of the normal distribution. 

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$

The shape will always be a bell. The critical parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ determine the location and the height/width of the curve. The mean can be any real number and the standard deviation can be any positive real number.

The area beneath a normal curve is always 1.


## Visualizing the Standard Normal

```{r, fig.height = 4.25, echo = FALSE}
sn_pdf <- ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4), breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Standard Normal Distribution N(0, 1)", x = "x", y = "f(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
sn_pdf
```

Notice that there is very little area under the curve outside ± $3$.


## Another Normal Distribution

```{r, fig.height = 4.25, echo = FALSE}
mu    <- 69
sigma <- 3
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mu, sigma)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(mu - (4 * sigma), mu + (4 * sigma)),
                     breaks = seq(mu - (4 * sigma), mu + (4 * sigma), sigma)) +
  labs(title = "US Adult Male Heights ~ N(69, 9)", 
       x = "inches", 
       y = "f(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw() +
  annotate("label", 
           x = 69, 
           y = 0.05, 
           label = "same area") +
  annotate("label", 
           x = 62.0, 
           y = 0.10, 
           label = "different scaling") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = c(59.5, 63), 
                   xend = c(57, 66), 
                   y = c(0.10, 0.0925), 
                   yend = c(0.10, 0.001)), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm")),
               color = "#FE6100", size = 1.25)
```

Notice that there is very little area under the curve outside ± $3\sigma$.


## The Empirical Rule

The normal distribution is unimodal and perfectly symmetric.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg" width = 425></p>

* approximately 68% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$ 
* approximately 95% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ 
* approximately 99.7% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ 

The tails extend to $\pm \infty$ ; any value of $x$ is *theoretically possible*.


## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The probability of the random variable $X$ taking on a value less than or equal to a specific value $x$ is found using the CDF, which integrates the area under the curve. This is similar to summing a discrete distribution like the binomial or calculating an empirical cumulative distribution function for a sample of data. 

$$F(x)=P(X \leq x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}dx$$

The normal distribution has no closed-form solution for $F(x)$. `R` has a function for the normal CDF (and its inverse, which we will discuss later). Prior to digital technology, people used [tables of solutions](http://www.z-table.com/) computed for the standard normal curve Z.


## Visualizing the Standard Normal

```{r, fig.height = 4.25, echo = FALSE}
sn_cdf <- ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = pnorm, 
                args = list(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4), 
                     breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Standard Normal Distribution N(0, 1)", 
       x = "x", 
       y = "F(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
sn_cdf
```

Notice the logistic (S) shape with the inflection point at $\mu = 0$.


## Another Normal Distribution

```{r, fig.height = 4.25, echo = FALSE}
mu    <- 69
sigma <- 3
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = pnorm, 
                args = list(mu, sigma)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(mu - (4 * sigma), mu + (4 * sigma)),
     breaks = seq(mu - (4 * sigma), mu + (4 * sigma), sigma)) +
  labs(title = "US Adult Male Heights ~ N(69, 9)", 
       x = "inches", 
       y = "F(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
```

Notice the logistic (S) shape with the inflection point at $\mu = 69$.

## 

```{r, fig.height = 4.50, echo = FALSE}
grid.arrange(sn_pdf, sn_cdf)
```

Notice how the two normal distribution plots correspond. Recall that $F(x)$---the CDF---is the integral of $f(x)$---the pdf.

In other words, solving is the equivalent of integrating between 0 and 1 using the standard normal CDF with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.

$$\int\limits_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}dx$$

## More on Quantiles

The quantiles are the cumulative percentages and percentiles labeled on the image below. Note the cumulative percentages associated with the Empirical rule ($1\sigma$, $2\sigma$, and $3\sigma$ above and below $\mu$). These are true for all normal distributions.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg" width = 600></p>


## But what about P(X = x)?

The normal distribution is a continuous function, so the area under a point is zero and $P(X = x)$ is technically zero. Then how can we use the normal model for data?

Many variables are theoretically continuous, but measurements are always inherently discrete---we round all our measurements to some number of decimal places. 

We treat $P(X = x)$ as a narrow area beneath the curve rather than a single point. For example, if I measure people's height in inches and round to two decimal places, the probability that a person is 70.00 inches tall (5'10") is modeled as the probability that they are between 69.995 and 70.005 inches.

We *never* use the pmf to compute probabilities; it only maps the function, with $f(x)$ = the height of the curve at $x$.


## Expected Value and Variance

The theoretical expected value and variance for any distribution are generally found as follows. We cannot integrate $f(x)$, but it can be demonstrated that expected value and variance simplify to the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for the normal distribution.

$$E[X] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x f(x) \rightarrow \mu$$

$$Var[X] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (x - \mu)^2 f(x) \rightarrow \sigma^2$$
