## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

# Model Overview

## The Normal Model

$$X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

$x$ = {-$\infty$ to +$\infty$} 

$\mu$ = the mean of the distribution  

$\sigma^2$ = the variance of the distribution  

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$

$$F(x) = \text{no closed-form solution}$$

$$E[X] = \mu \text{ and }Var[X] = \sigma^2$$


## The Empirical Rule

The normal distribution is unimodal and perfectly symmetric.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg" width = 425></p>

* approximately 68% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$ 
* approximately 95% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ 
* approximately 99.7% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ 

The tails extend to $\pm \infty$ ; any value of $x$ is *theoretically possible*.


# Working With the PMF

## Calculating the pmf or f(x)

Recall the normal model's probability mass function (pmf).

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$

R has a function to solve the pmf for any normal model. Inputs may be single values or vectors. *We only use this for plotting the normal distribution, not for calculating probabilities.*

<center>$f(x)$ = `dnorm(x, mean, sd)`</center><br>

Note that the `R` function uses standard deviation ($\sigma$) rather than the variance ($\sigma^2$) as an input (argument) to the function. 


## Plotting the Standard Normal Z

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4), 
                     breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Z ~ N(0, 1)", x = "x", y = "f(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
```

```{r, fig.height = 2.6, echo = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4), 
                     breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Z ~ N(0, 1)", x = "x", y = "f(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
```


## General Plotting Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# set the parameters of the normal model
mu    <- 0
sigma <- 1

# adapt the labels for the given problem
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mu, sigma)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(mu - (4 * sigma), 
                                mu + (4 * sigma)),
                     breaks = seq(from = mu - (4 * sigma), 
                                  to   = mu + (4 * sigma), 
                                  by   = sigma)) +
  labs(title = "informative title here", 
       x = "description or units of x", 
       y = "f(x)") + 
  theme_linedraw()
```


# Working With the CDF

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

Recall also the normal model's CDF.

$$F(x)=P(X \leq x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}dx$$

$P(X \leq x)$ = `pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)`

$P(X > x)$ = `pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail = FALSE)`

For any continuous distribution $P(X = x) = 0$ (area under a single point is zero). Therefore, $P(X \leq x)$ and $P(X < x)$ are mathematically equivalent. However, we might use a *continuity correction* when approximating discretely measured data.

## The Inverse CDF

In the discussions above, we found the area to the left of a given point (or *quantile*) on the x-axis. Sometimes we need to solve the reverse kind of problem: given an area or probability, what is the corresponding quantile or quantiles?

$F^{-1}(x)$ = `qnorm(p, mean, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)` 

If the area is to the right of the unknown value x (the upper tail) rather than to the left (the lower tail), then specify upper tail.

$F^{-1}(x)$ = `qnorm(p, mean, sd, lower.tail = FALSE)`

If we know $\mu$, $\sigma$, and either the value(s) of x or the area(s)...

`qnorm(p, mean, sd) = q` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `pnorm(q, mean, sd) = p`

# Sampling and Simulating

## Sampling from a Normal Distribution

In addition to calculating probabilities, we can simulate random normal values in `R` using `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`.

*n* = the number of random values (sample size)

*mean* = the mean of the distribution
    
*sd* = the standard deviation of the distribution

As with the other *norm* functions, the default parameter settings in `rnorm()` are `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`. 

If we want a sample from the standard normal distribution, we only need to enter a value for sample size, `rnorm(n)`.
