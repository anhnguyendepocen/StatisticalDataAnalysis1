## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

<p>"...the object of statistical methods is the reduction of data. A quantity of data, which usually by its mere bulk is incapable of entering the mind, is to be replaced by relatively few quantities which shall adequately represent the whole, or...shall contain as much as possible, ideally the whole, of the relevant information contained in the original data." ~ R.A. Fisher, 1921</p>


## How We Describe Data Distributions

**Categorical Variables**

* frequency / relative frequency

*Summaries based on counting how many times categories occur.*

**Quantitative Variables**

* shape
* center
* spread
* outliers

*Shape, center, and spread characterize the pattern of numerical observations. Outliers are deviations from the pattern.*


## Exploring Categorical Data

* frequency table
* relative frequency table
* cumulative frequency table
* cumulative relative frequency table
* contingency table
* [bar chart / barplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html)
* ~~pie chart~~

“There is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot be displayed better in some other type of chart.” 

(Some people attribute this quote to John Tukey. That cannot be verified, but it is generally a true statement.)


## Berkeley Data

In the early 1970s, UC Berkeley was concerned about possible sex discrimination in grad school admissions. The [berkeley.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv) dataset contains fall 1973 data for the six largest departments. Click the link to get the URL for the dataset.

The Berkeley dataset is an example of a statistical phenomena called [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).

Load the dataset into `R` from its URL:

`library(tidyverse)`

`berkdata <- read_csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv"))`

```{r echo=FALSE}
berkdata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv")
```


## Inspect the Dataset

```{r}
glimpse(berkdata)
head(berkdata, n = 3)
```


## The Variables

There are three categorical variables in the Berkeley dataset.

* `sex`

whether the applicant was male or female (1970s definitions)

* `department`

the department to which the applicant applied (A through F)

* `status`

whether the applicant was accepted or rejected

<hr>

Each *observation* in the dataset represents one applicant, with a total of `r nrow(berkdata)` observations. 


## What is "grammar of graphics"?

* R's `ggplot2` is a system for creating graphics, based on the concepts introduced in the book [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1477928463&sr=8-1&keywords=the+grammar+of+graphics&linkCode=sl1&tag=ggplot2-20&linkId=f0130e557161b83fbe97ba0e9175c431) (2005) --- metastructure and connected visualizations

* *aesthetics* (like x, y, color, size, fill) code data or variables from a dataset onto the plot (*what* you want to plot)

* graphical elements displayed in a plot (like points, lines, or bars) are *geometries* (*how* you want to plot)

* you can include multiple geometries on your plot, using the same or different aesthetics for each

* *facets* allow us to visualize the same graphical elements for important groups or subsets of data 


## Barplots using ggplot2

```{r fig.height=3.4}
library(ggplot2) # even better, use library(tidyerse)

ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) +  # the data we want to plot
  geom_bar()                      # how we want to plot data
```


##

Add some formatting to get a more useful and pleasing plot. First, a title and more informative x-axis label. We could also change the y-axis label with `y =`.

```{r fig.height=2.8}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad School Applicants F73", 
       x = "applicant sex (as per 1970s definitions)")
```


##

Options `subtitle` and `caption` let us add more information.

```{r fig.height=2.9}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad School Applicants F73", 
       subtitle = "applicants to the largest six departments only",
       x = "applicant sex (as per 1970s definitions)",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset")
```


##

Now some color! Try to choose colorblind-friendly options.

```{r fig.height=2.9}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "gray") +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad School Applicants F73", 
       subtitle = "applicants to the largest six departments only",
       x = "applicant sex (as per 1970s definitions)",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset")
```


##

```{r fig.height=2.9}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) + # add fill for 2 colors
  geom_bar() +            # you can add an outline color if you want
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "skyblue")) + # choose colors
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad School Applicants F73", 
       subtitle = "applicants to the largest six departments only",
       x = "applicant sex (as per 1970s definitions)",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")    # removes redundant fill legend

```


## Proportions Instead of Counts

If we want proportions, we have to calculate them in the plot.

```{r fig.height=3.1}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..count../sum(..count..))) + # a little clunky
  labs(y = "proportion")   # we also have to fix the y-axis label
```


## Barplots for Two Variables

One variable is the bars (`x`), while the other variable is how the bars are split (`fill`).

```{r fig.height=3.1}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


## Bars Side-by-Side (Dodged) vs. Stacked

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```


## Proportions vs. Counts

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + labs(y = "proportion")
```


## Barplots from Summarized Data

We can still make a barplot if we have summarized vs. raw data.

```{r fig.height=2.75}
dept_tab <- count(berkdata, department)
ggplot(dept_tab, aes(x = department, y = n)) + 
  geom_col() +   # use geom_col() since we are specifying y values
  labs(y = "count")
```


## More About Color

_Cookbook for R_ shows some [color options](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) and built-in palettes. You can use colors by name (use `colors()` function to see `R`'s list), hex code, or rgb (e.g., [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) or [ColorHexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/)). Consider [colorblind safe](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) color options when making plots for papers, presentations, or generally sharing with others.

* _color_ typically refers to points, lines, outlines
* _fill_ typically refers to shapes' internal shading

```{r plotcolor1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black") +   # this will be the outline color
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFC20A", "#0C7BDC")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants, Fall 1973",
       subtitle = "six departments with largest applicant pools",
       x = "sex of applicant", y = "number of applicants",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset")
```


## Voila! New Colors

This is a generally colorblind-safe pair of colors, as is the default cyan (#00BFC4) and salmon-ish (#F8766D) combination seen in the earlier two-variable plots.

```{r plotcolor1a, ref.label='plotcolor1', echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.7}

```


## Three Variables? Use Faceting

Faceting creates multiple "panes" in a plot according to some chosen grouping variable. Each pane displays the same kind of plot for a given subgroup. Use `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` (more structured) to achieve different configurations.

```{r plotcolor2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFC20A", "#0C7BDC")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants, Fall 1973",
       subtitle = "six departments with largest applicant pools",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset",
       x = "sex of applicant",
       y = "number of applicants") +
  facet_grid(. ~ department)
```


##

Six plots configured into a 1 x 6 faceted grid show `status` for men and women, with one plot for each department. What would happen if you coded `facet_grid(department ~ .)` instead of the current `facet_grid(. ~ department)`?

```{r plotcolor2a, ref.label='plotcolor2', echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}

```


##

The plot with `facet_grid(department ~ .)` --- we've switched to each plot being its own row versus column in the faceted grid. What are the pros versus cons of this plot versus the previous?

```{r plotcolor2b, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 4.4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFC20A", "#0C7BDC")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants, Fall 1973",
       subtitle = "six departments with largest applicant pools",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset",
       x = "sex of applicant",
       y = "number of applicants") +
  facet_grid(department ~ .)
```


## A Quick Word about Faceting

Statisticians and others have struggled with how to effectively and efficiently visualize *multivariate data*. We often use colors or shapes, but the result can be messy.

The `facet_grid()` function creates separate plots for a given variable or variables and arranges them in a grid or matrix, as specified by (`rowvariable` ~ `columnvariable`). When you use only one variable, substitute a `.` for the missing one. The grid dimensions are determined by how many levels (categories or unique values) each variable has.

The `facet_wrap()` function tries to optimize for a rectangular arrangement of the resulting plots.

Conceptually, faceting in a plot is similar to using `group_by()` when computing summaries.


## Using `facet.wrap()` vs. `facet.grid()`

Plots wrapped into rows using `facet_wrap(~ department)`. With 6 plots, the 2 $\times$ 3 grid is an "optimal" wrapped layout.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(berkdata, aes(x = sex, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFC20A", "#0C7BDC")) +
  labs(title = "Berkeley Grad Applicants in Fall 73",
       subtitle = "six departments with largest applicant pools",
       caption = "source: berkeley.csv dataset",
       x = "sex of applicant",
       y = "number of applicants") +
  facet_wrap(~ department)
```


## Drawing Conclusions

* Women were more likely to apply to departments that were harder to get into. There were far fewer female applicants to A and B, which accept more than 60% of all applicants. What looks like an overall bias is a result of this phenomenon. The individual departments sometimes *favor* women (which you will see when we revisit this dataset).

* Do you prefer tables or barplots for exploring the data? Why?

* Are there other summaries that would help you understand these data better? What other data would you like to have?
