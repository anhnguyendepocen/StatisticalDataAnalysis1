## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## Are data from a normal distribution?

Many statistical tests require data to be drawn from a normal distribution. Researchers may also interested in determining whether some variable of interest is normally distributed. For example, Belgian scholar [Adolphe Quetelet](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Quetelet.html) (1796-1874) had a hypothesis that the natural distribution of human heights is a bell curve (i.e., normal distribution). 

We can never *prove* that unknown data come from a normal distribution, but we can compare the data to the theoretical model and determine whether the data deviates too far to be considered approximately normal.

Let's first investigate this using height data gathered by another famous statistician. [Francis Galton](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galton.html) (1822-1911) investigated the relationship between the heights of parents and their offspring. Some of his data can be found in [galtonparentheights.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonparentheights.csv).


## The Galton Height Data (Parents)

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
parent_hts <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonparentheights.csv")
```

```{r}
head(parent_hts)
```

This time we will calculate mean and standard deviation using base `R` methods. These sample values will serve as parameter estimates for our theoretical model and plots.

```{r}
xbar <- mean(parent_hts$Mother)
s <- sd(parent_hts$Mother)
```


## Density Plot

Does the density of the data match a theoretical normal density plot with the same mean and variance as the data? 

Create a density plot of the data and superimpose a theoretical normal model on the same axes. Does the data deviate too far from the shape of the theoretical model?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(x = Mother)) +
  geom_density() +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(xbar, s),
                color = "orange",
                size = 1)
```

Notice we are using `dnorm` because the density plot shows f(x).


## Data vs. Theoretical

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(x = Mother)) +
  geom_density() +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(xbar, s),
                color = "orange",
                size = 1) +
  theme_linedraw()
```


## Questions

* Is the data distribution unimodal like the theoretical normal distribution?

* Is the data distribution skewed (left or right) or approximately symmetric?

* How well does the distribution of data match the theoretical curve in the tails? Where does it it deviate? 

* Is there a pattern to any data deviations from the theoretical normal curve, or do they appear to be random?

* In general, we are most concerned about moderate or strong skew in the data, outliers, and distinct bi- or multi-modality.


## Empirical Cumulative Distribution Plot

Does the ECDF of the data match a theoretical normal CDF plot with the same mean and variance?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(x = Mother)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  stat_function(
    fun = pnorm,
    args = list(xbar, s),
    color = "orange",
    size = 1)
```

Create an ECDF plot of the data and superimpose a theoretical normal model on the same axes. Does the data deviate too far from the shape of the theoretical model?

Notice we are using `pnorm` because the ECDF plot shows F(x).


## Data vs. Theoretical

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(x = Mother)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  stat_function(
    fun = pnorm,
    args = list(xbar, s),
    color = "orange",
    size = 1) +
  theme_linedraw()
```


## Reminder: Theoretical Normal Curve

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg"></p>

Notice the placement of the percentiles (also called quantiles) on the theoretical normal distribution. If we know $\mu$ and $\sigma$ we can determine the locations of the quantiles. For example, look at the *deciles*, which are the 10th, 20th, 30th, etc. percentiles.

This will allow us to contruct a normal quantile-quantile plot, also known as a QQ plot or  normal probability plot.


##

Do the data deciles match the theoretical normal deciles?

```{r}
deciles <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)
tibble(percentile = deciles * 100,
       data       = quantile(parent_hts$Mother, deciles),
       theory     = qnorm(deciles, xbar, s))
```


## Plot of Data vs. Theoretical Deciles

```{r, echo = FALSE}
deciles <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)
plotdata <- tibble(percentile = deciles * 100,
                   data       = quantile(parent_hts$Mother, deciles),
                   theory     = qnorm(deciles, xbar, s))
ggplot(plotdata, aes(x = theory, y = data, label = percentile)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, 
              intercept = 0, 
              color = "orange",
              size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label(size = 4,
             nudge_y = 0.5) +
  labs(caption = "points are labeled with their corresponding percentile values")
```


## Quantile-Quantile Plot (QQ Plot)

Do the quantiles of the data match the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution with the same mean and variance?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(sample = Mother)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "orange",
               size = 1)
```

Notice in aesthetics syntax, we use `sample =` rather than `x =` to indicate the variable to be plotted. 

In the final plot, the x axis will be the theoretical quantiles on a standard normal curve, while the y axis is the quantiles from the data. There is a point representing each data value.


## QQ Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(parent_hts, aes(sample = Mother)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "orange",
               size = 1)
```


## Skewness and Kurtosis

The skewness of a normal distribution is 0 and the kurtosis is 3. Data from a normal distribution should have similar values.

```{r}
library(moments)
skewK <- tibble(
  statistic = c("Skewness", "Kurtosis", "Excess K"),
  theory = c(0, 3, 0),
  data = round(c(skewness(parent_hts$Mother),
                 kurtosis(parent_hts$Mother),
                 kurtosis(parent_hts$Mother) - 3), 2))
print.data.frame(skewK, row.names = FALSE)
```


## Galton Height Data

Assess the other Galton height measurements for normality. For the child data, perform the assessment with and without groups by gender. Was Quetelet right to think human height is normally distributed? How do you know?

* [galtonheightdata.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonheightdata.csv) (for child data)

Additional human measurements can be found in the following datasets. Do they confirm or contradict Quetelet's hypotheses about height or other measurements? How do you know?

* [anthropometric.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/anthropometric.csv)
* [pearsonheightdata.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/pearsonheightdata.csv)


## Exploring Other Distributions

Construct a `tibble` containing samples of size 50 drawn from the following distributions. Assess normality for each sample. Repeat with samples of 1000.

<table>

$X_1 \text{~} Unif(0,1)$<br>

</table><p>

For each distribution, consider the shape of its pmf or pdf and CDF versus those of the normal distribution. 

Look at the shapes that tend to be produced by skewed data, data that is flatter than a bell curve (e.g., uniform), or discrete data (e.g., binomial), as well as skewness and kurtosis.
