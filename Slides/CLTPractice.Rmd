## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## Recap: The Normal Model

$$X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$

$x$ = {-$\infty$ to +$\infty$} 

$\mu$ = the mean of the distribution = any real number

$\sigma^2$ = the variance of the distribution = any positive real number

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$$

$$E[X] = \mu$$

$$Var[X] = \sigma^2$$


## Recap: The Empirical Rule

The normal distribution is unimodal and perfectly symmetric.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Moodlepics/normaldist.jpg" width = 425></p>

* approximately 68% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 1\sigma$ 
* approximately 95% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ 
* approximately 99.7% of the curve's area is between $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ 

The tails extend to $\pm \infty$ ; any value of $x$ is *theoretically possible*.


## Recap: Normal Functions in `R`

Recall that `R` has several functions for computing probabilities, finding quantiles, and generating samples of random values from the normal distribution.

* `dnorm` = computes the height of the pdf at $x$

* `pnorm` = computes $P(X \leq x)$

* `pnorm` = computes $P(X > x)$ with `lower.tail = FALSE`

* `qnorm` = computes the $q^{th}$ percentile

* `rnorm` = generates a sample of random values

Use `?dnorm` in the console to review syntax for each function.


## Recap: General Plotting Code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# set the parameters of the normal model
mu    <- 0
sigma <- 1

# adapt the labels for the given problem
ggplot() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mu, sigma)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(mu - (4 * sigma), 
                                mu + (4 * sigma)),
                     breaks = seq(from = mu - (4 * sigma), 
                                  to   = mu + (4 * sigma), 
                                  by   = sigma)) +

## Birth Weights

* A 2002 study found that the birth weights of full-term babies in the UK were approximately normal with $\mu = 3.4$ kg and $\sigma = 0.6$ kg. The range for normal birth weight is 2.5 to 4.0 kg. 

A. What is the probability that a full-term newborn is above normal birth weight?

B. In a particular hospital, nine full-term babies were born in a given week. What is the probability that the average birth weight of these babies was above normal birth weight?

C. For a sample of 100 full-term babies, there is a 95% chance that their average birth weight is between what two values (if the region of interest is centered on the mean)?

D. Plot the normal distributions used in (A) through (C).


## Digital Signals

* A digital comm channel has a signal degradation problem, so there is a 0.1% chance that any bit sent on it will be received in error. Bits are independent and the error rate is constant. You send a test message that is 12,000 bits long. Let X be the total number of errors in the test message.

A. Using the exact binomial, what is the probability of getting 6 or fewer errors?

B. Using a normal approximation for X, what is the probability of getting 6 or fewer errors?

C. Using the normal approximation for $\hat{p}$, what is the probability of getting 6/12000 or fewer errors?

D. Plot the normal distributions used in (B) and (C).
